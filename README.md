# Assets

#### Scripts
- [makechange.py](https://github.com/Cache-core/Assets/blob/master/scripts/makechange.py) - Used to create MixIn for the Cache blockchain, aiding in anonymity.

#### Version Control
- [version.txt](https://github.com/Cache-core/Assets/blob/master/version.txt) - Used to tell the Desktop wallet if it needs an update. **This will need updating on every [Core RC](https://github.com/Cache-core/Cache/releases) + [Desktop RC](https://github.com/Cache-core/Cache-Desktop/releases)**
